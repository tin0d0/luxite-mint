# Security Policy

### Reporting security problems in the LUXITE mint contract

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** to report a security problem.

Instead please use this [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/tin0d0/luxite-mint/security/advisories/new) link.
Provide a helpful title, detailed description of the vulnerability and an exploit
proof-of-concept. Speculative submissions without proof-of-concept will be closed
with no further consideration.

If you haven't done so already, please **enable two-factor auth** in your GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible in the advisory, typically within 72 hours.

If you do not receive a response in the advisory, send an email to
tino@localuniverse.io with the full URL of the advisory you have created.  DO NOT
include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the
security issue in this email. **Only provide such details in the advisory**.

If you do not receive a response from tino@localuniverse.io please followup with
the team directly. You can do this in the `#general` channel of the
[Local Universe discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BjzUSYU9mK), by pinging the `Team`
role in the channel and referencing the fact that you submitted a security problem.
